    In this section we want to help understand you - today! What do you like & want to do with your money that helps you live the life you want to live today.

    We will look at your big picture money allocation as well as your categories to give some insights on how you may be feeling month to month. This will let you discover where you can play around more with your long-term vision as well as how you can optimise this month or this year.

    For this first section: please reference your last three months of income & spending to average a normal month. Checking your credit card / debit card bills is a great way to go. We find this also makes it easier to be honest with expenses. In the second section you can break it down into rough groups to see how it usually plays out in smaller categories.

    Before we get into the next section: there is no right or wrong ratio it depends on how much you already have in savings and investments but for reference usually if savings + investments is less than 10% you may be limited in what you can do in your â€˜Future Youâ€™. But donâ€™t worry - weâ€™ll get there!

            **Insights:**

            Fixed expenses: Usually if your fixed expenses, the expenses you canâ€™t easily change month to month, are more than 60-70% of your total take-home income you can feel anxiety around your money. This is because you have less and less to play with when big expenses come up, you over exceed your usual spending in a small category, like groceries, or feel that the money is going out as quickly as itâ€™s coming in.

            Savings & Investing: A great rule of thumb is to save 10-20% of your income. Once youâ€™ve maxed out your rainy day savings (3-6 months of your income) you can switch almost all of that money to long-term investments.

            Fun money! This is the money that can make life feel worth living. Be that shopping, vacations, your morning Starbucks; this is your money to do what you want with that changes month-to-month. Our finger in the air suggestion is somewhere around 10-30% of your take home income.
